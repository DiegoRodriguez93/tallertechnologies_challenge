# Code Challenge: Full-Stack Blockchain Engineer

## Code Challenge

### Task

Create a simple decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to submit and view governance proposals. The application should have a frontend built with Next.js and TypeScript, and it should interact with a smart contract deployed on a test Ethereum network (e.g., Rinkeby or Goerli). The smart contract should allow users to create proposals and retrieve a list of all proposals.

### Requirements

1.  Frontend:

    *   Use Next.js and TypeScript to create a simple user interface.
    *   Implement a form to submit a new governance proposal.
    *   Display a list of all submitted proposals.

2.  Smart Contract:

    *   Write a simple Solidity smart contract that allows users to:

        *   Create a proposal (with a title and description).
        *   Retrieve all proposals.

    *   Deploy the smart contract to a test network (Rinkeby or Goerli).

3.  Integration:

    *   Use Web3.js or Ethers.js to connect the frontend to the smart contract.
    *   Ensure that the application can read from and write to the smart contract.

### Constraints

*   The challenge should be solvable in less than 30 minutes.
*   Candidates should be able to use free test networks and tools.
